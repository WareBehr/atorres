MultiplayerTopDown


-====March 18, 2015====-
Beginning work on a multiplayer topdown hack 'n slash game.  These notes will be not be concerned
with design aspects but rather focus on programming.  this is to help evaluate problem solving, 
estimates, and archive changes throughout development.


Adding photon unity network (PUN) assets to the project.  created network manager to manage
connecting/connection to photon cloud server.  

lobby and room connectivity achieved.  beginning work on instantiating an avatar for each player
with photonnetwork.instantiate.

instantiation and movement working as intended.  need to smooth movement between clients.

added networkplayer script to hold all things needing to be tracked for photonview.  this may be
obsolete as photonview observes multiple components now.

added lerping to the network player to smooth.  currently the updatetime is at 0.1f, but the result 
is not as desirable.  movement is smooth, but too slow.  

attempted to fix the updatetime, but increasing the time or changing to time.deltatime didn't 
help.  the 0.1f update time works best for the moment.

added caches for components in networkplayer and added reference to currentDirection for animator
works well enough, but the animator stops just short of reaching the destination.  this furthers
the "sliding" effect that the lerping has on the players from other clients.

beginning work on persistent direction so that players continue to look in the direction they
were last moving toward.

found the answer for persistent direction through animation.  used blender trees to transition 
between an idlestate and runningstate. add an additional variable to be passed called speed, 
which was used to determine blending the animations.

starting to work on making the attack colliders

-====March 20, 2015====-

created new animations for moving up,down,left,right and created rough forward swing animation
"Sword.cs" holds the animation information currently, but I may make a PlayerInventory script 
to hold a weapon's values to pass to the player controller.

forward swing works, but weapon is swung while mouse button is pressed down.  need to work on a 
"cooldown" to prevent it.

added animations for attacking in all directions with a one handed weapon.  rough "cooldown"
added.

looking into creating layers for animation 

layers seem to be a 3D feature more than a 2D one.  Ill needto look into other tools for blending
sprite animations

found a bug in the animation.  swingcomplete is being called causing the animation to reset speed 
to 0.0f

using seperate game objects to create layers for the animations 

-====April 10, 2015====-
adding more animations for the lower body and changing animation keys.

Removed Blendtree states from animator.  The blend tree was interferring with the fluidity of the 
animations.
animations between the weapon and  torso are still not completely in sync.

-====April 25, 2015====-
back logged: synced the torso and weapon animations.  changed "sword.cs" to "meleeweapon.cs"


added a condition to meleeweapon.Attack() that avoids the duplication of box colliders.  Checks
to make sure the hitcollider is null before proceeding to create a new collider.
